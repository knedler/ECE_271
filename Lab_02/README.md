##  Lab Report ##

What is something cool you did in this lab?
-----------
Your answer: I was able to get the rotation of the motor to change based on the state of the push button on the board. When the button is released the motor will spin clockwise, when the button is pushed the motor will spin counter clockwise.


Post-lab Questions
-------

* Answers to Question 1: Instead of the Darlington array on the board we could create our own Darlington pairs to achieve higher current. There are also other forms of Darlington arrays that only have 4 outputs instead of 8 giving us more current per output.

* Answers to Question 2: Yes it is possible to micro-step. This is done by modifying the current in between the steps. As half-stepping is just on or off, micro-stepping can be achieved by adding points in between fully on and fully off.


Lab Demo Questions
-------
5. Is the highest update frequency of half-stepping higher than that of full-stepping? Why? 

- The update frequency of half-stepping is higher than that of full-stepping because there are more steps/stages in half-stepping. Thus there are more delays in the steps allowing the motor to move to the next step before continuing.
