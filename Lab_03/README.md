Post-lab Questions

* Answers to Question 1: No the scan algorithm cannot detect multiple keys at a time. If 2 or more columns are active it will select to the first one in the algorithm and start looking through the rows. Similarly if 2 or more rows are active it will select the first one in the algorithm. The algorithm can only select 1 key at a time.


Lab Demo Questions
-------

* Answers to Question "Do all keypresses show up on display?": Yes all keypresses show up.

* Answers to Question "How do you debounce the key press?": I have a delay in my keypad scan function that allows me to debouce the pressed signal.

* Answers to Question "Why did we need to use external pull-up resistors insetead of built-in ones?": The internal pull up is not powerfull enough for our use case. Thus we needed to add the external pull for the key press.
