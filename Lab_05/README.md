Your answer: For this lab I made the blue button change the direction of the motor. It by default rotates clockwise but when the button is pressed than it will rotate counter clockwise.


Post-lab Questions
-------

* Answers to Question 1: ABI is helpful due to how it requires code to be created. It allows you to know which registers are avaiable to modify without causing errors in the rest of the code. You wouldn't want to just pick any register you want because even if it works for a small use case, if the code is to be used again in the future or interacted with another ABI program it would cause issues when if it followed ABI it would be fine.

* Answers to Question 2: Using the stack for local variables in C provides better performance, modularity, and safety compared to relying solely on global variables.
